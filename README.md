# The Red Manual

### The Red Manual is a sort of encyclopedia, a playbook, a manual for cyber offense.

###### NOTE: I myself am still learning the trade, as I learn new things I will improve this. It is highly subject to changes.

This shouldn't be thought of as an equivilant to a fully educational guide to learning hacking, however this also isn't meant to be a garbled notebook. This should be thought of as something for newbies to refer to for practical information they'll need in the field as they stretch their wings, primarily during CTFs. In the pursuit of this goal, the manual needs to abide by these rules to do it's job the way it should:
 
 - The manual must always be about hacking, and not be sidetracked explaining other topics such as programming and networking basics
 - The manual must not become a copy of other documentation or a full tutorial on how to use something
 - The manual must remain clear while having as little words as possible
